# Github Battle

Utilizing the Github API, users can search the most popular repos in all coding languages or narrow it down to one specific lanuage. Users can also switch to the Battle view, which allows them to battle two different github users and determine a winner based on number of repos.

Users can also switch between a light interface and a dark interface using the flashlight/lightbulb icon on the top right.
